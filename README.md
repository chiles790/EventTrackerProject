# EventTrackerProject

# Fitness Tracker

## Overview
This program is designed to perform Full CRUD, allowing the user to create, update, search individual workouts and delete date from the database that I created.

Week 2 had us create a frontend using javascript and Visual Studio Code.

## What I learned.
There were certainly tough moments, with trying to search by type of exercise however the rest of the project was fun and relatively easy. This past week working in Xtreme9lives I felt like I wasn't grasping it well. This weekend project however really helped me apply what we had covered and feel far more confident. Having not used Mysql since before our midterm, I was happy to get the practice in the application and feel more comfortable using it.
Javascript still feels very foreign to me but the homework this weekend helped with some aspects I was struggling with. The addition of Visual Studio Code was very helpful compared to SpringToolSuite when using javascript. I still struggled with the update portion of my project and will need to revisit.
