##What I learned.
There were certainly tough moments, with trying to search by type of exercise however the rest of the project was fun and relatively easy. This past week working in Xtreme9lives I felt like I wasn't grasping it well. This weekend project however really helped me apply what we had covered and feel far more confident. Having not used Mysql since before our midterm, I was happy to get the practice in the application and feel more comfortable using it.
